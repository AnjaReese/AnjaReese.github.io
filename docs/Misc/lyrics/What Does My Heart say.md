Follow your heart, they say
Do what you love and you won't work a day
Follow your dream, they preach 
Same old lessons so easy to teach
But what about those don't get a choice
Decisions made for us since we were little boys
Spending our lifes with a voice inside thinking maybe I should try
I don't know, I'm unsure, what my feature's gonna be
But i know this
I can't stand around and let it pass by me
I am young, still got time
Should I stay and wait and see
Or should I change my life for me
What does my heart say
What does my heart say
Disappointment we all avoided
All for love in our parents' eyes
And we give into a life of lies
Fires burns and tables turned
And I come to learn that maybe it's not for me
I wanna change my life
Maybe I should try
Maybe I should try
I don't know, I'm unsure, what my feature's gonna be
But i know this
I can't stand around and let it pass by me
I am young, still got time
Should I stay and wait and see
Or should I change my life for me
What Does My Heart say?
What Does My Heart say?
Fear, fear is what holds us down
Leaving us safe and sound
We fear it all
Fear, fear of the disapproving minds
Fear of the things we leave behind
Too scared to rise out of fear that would fall
Cause we fear rejection
We fear depression
We fear regret and mistakes
And forget it's okay to be reckless 
Life is intense and though we fear failure
Easy ways never made a good sailor
Wanna fly but I won't leave the floor
Wanna go but won't open the door
What am I waiting for?
Now I know, now I'm sure
This feature is not for me
But I know this
I can't stand around and let life pass by me
I am young
Now it's time I can't stay and wait and see
Need to change my mind
Need to change my life
Need to change my life for me
MY HEART SAYS GO
MY HEART SAYS GO
