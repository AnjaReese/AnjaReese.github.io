## 1 Question 1: Pipeline Design Concept

### 1.1 A

(a) Answer the following choice questions about pipelined processor design. (2 points each)

![[sys2hw2quesapic.png]]

- Pipelining improves the [A] throughput of instructions. 
- A single-cycle implementation violates the great idea of making the common case fast. [A] True
- A longer instruction pipeline is usually associated with higher clock speeds.  [A] True
- Deeper pipelines with more stages can degrade execution performance. [A] True.
- If the instruction `add x4, x1, x0` is inserted after `ld x1, 100(x4)`, then the last instruction in the pipeline starts execution at time [B] 800ps (assuming all forwarding is implemented).

### 1.2 B

(b) Assume that the critical path in Instruction fetch takes 100ps, Reading or Writing Registers takes 100ps, ALU Computing takes 30ps, Data Access takes 500ps. Compute the minimum clock period achievable for the single-cycle and the pipelined design. How much speedup do you achieve over the single-cycle design?(10 points)

- IF: 100ps
- ID: 100ps
- EXE: 30ps
- MEM: 500ps
- WB: 100ps

$Clock_{Pipeline} = 5 \times Clock_{MEM} = 2500ps$

$Time\ Per\ Inst_{Pipeline} = 5 \times Clock_{Pipeline} = 2500ps$ 

理想状况下同时可以跑5条指令

$Clock_{single} = \Sigma^5_{i = 1}C_i = 830ps$

$$
Speed Up = \frac{Clock_{single}}{Clock_{Pipeline}} = \frac{830ps}{500ps} = 1.66
$$

### 1.3 C

(c) Based on the critical path in (b), if we want to turn the five-stage into four-stage, which two stages will you merget together to achieve the best performance ? Explain it and compute the speedup again.(you can use stage name IF/ID/EX/MEM/WB) (15 points)

ID EXE 接近，且 EXE 做的事情最少，只需要 30ps，将 ID 和 EXE 阶段合并

- IF: 100ps
- IDEXE: 130ps
- MEM: 500ps
- WB: 100ps

$Time\ Per\ Inst_{Pipeline} = 4 \times Clock_{Pipeline} = 2000ps$ 

$Clock_{Pipeline} = \frac{TimePerInst}{Insts} = 500ps$

$$
Speed Up = \frac{Clock_{single}}{Clock_{Pipeline}} = \frac{830ps}{500ps} = 1.66
$$

## 2 Question 2: Data Hazard and Forwarding (35 points)

![[sys2hw2ques2cpupic.png]]

### 2.1 A

(a) For the following sequence of instructions, insert NOPs to ensure correct execution if there is no forwarding and hazard detection. Change and rearrange the origin code to minimize the number of NOPs needed and give its space time diagram .(Assume register x17 can be used as temporary register)(15 points)

```arm-asm
add x15, x12, x11
ld  x13, 4(x15)
ld  x12, 0(x2)
or  x13, x15, x13
sd  x13, 0(x15)
```

After inserting NOPs: 根据数据冲突插入 NOP 指令。由于 reg 下降沿写入，所以 WB 阶段的数据冲突不考虑，需要 5 条。

```arm-asm
add x15, x12, x11
NOP
NOP
ld  x13, 4(x15)
ld  x12, 0(x2)
NOP
or  x13, x15, x13
NOP
NOP
sd  x13, 0(x15)
```

### 2.2 B

(b) Only considering the RAW(read after write)(see more in Note 2) data hazard, we have the count of forwarding instructions as Table 1. Under different situations, the execution time of different stages are shown as Table 2. What percent of cycles are stalls when running on a CPU with full forwarding? Explain why Why “MEM to 1st and MEM to 2nd” is not an entry in Table 1.(assume there are no any control transfer instructions)(10points)

![[sys2hw2tables.png]]

对于全面使用 forwarding 的 CPU 来说，“MEM to 1st” 会 stall 一个 clk。所以 stall 的百分比是 $0.2 / 1.2 = 16.7\%$

没有 “MEM to 1st" 和 "MEM to 2nd” 的情况，在题目所设计的五级流⽔线中，由于 WB 阶段的 Reg 下降沿写回，所以 ld 指令的数据 forward 只需要在 MEM/WB 阶段 Forwarding。等到下⼀个 clk 时 MEM 中读出的数据已经在时钟下降沿写回寄存器，不需要前递了。

### 2.3 C

(c) Based on the two tables above, note the two three-input forwarding Mux in EX stage before the ALU and assume we only have the two-input multiplexors. Whether it’s better to forward only from the EX/MEM pipeline register or only from the MEM/WB pipeline register? Compute their CPI resectively.(10 points)

1. 如果仅仅在 EXE/MEM 阶段 forwarding，需要的 stall 如下：

|Insts| Stalls  |
|  ----  | ----  |
|EX to 1st only|0|
|EX to 2nd only|1|
|MEM to 1st only|2|
|MEM to 2nd only|1|
|EX to 1st and EX to 2nd|1|

$$
CPI = 1 + 0.05\times1+0.2\times2+0.05\times1+0.1\times1+0.1\times1 = 1.65
$$

2. 如果仅仅在 MEM/WB 阶段 forwarding，需要的 stall 如下：

|Insts| Stalls  |
|  ----  | ----  |
|EX to 1st only|1|
|EX to 2nd only|0|
|MEM to 1st only|1|
|MEM to 2nd only|0|
|EX to 1st and EX to 2nd|1|

$$
CPI = 1 + 0.05\times1+0.2\times1+0.05\times0+0.1\times0+0.1\times1 = 1.35
$$

## 3 Question 3: Control Hazard and Branch Prediction (30 points)

### 3.1 A

(a) For all conditional branch instructions, we use static prediction strategies of always-taken and always- not-taken respectively. Which of these two policies is more accurate for the following code in C (translate the code into RV32I first and assume the array A has already been written in memory from address 0x800000 and the variable a is saved in register t0)? (10 points)

```c
int A[6] = {3, 7, 4, 9, 2, 1}
int a = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
	if (A[i] < 5) {
		a = a + 1;
	} else {
		a = a + 2;
	}
}
```

转化成 Assembly

```arm-asm
	addi t1, x0, 5
	addi t3, x0, 6
loop_start:
    beq  t1, t3, end # loop_end branch 1, not branch 5
    lw   a0, 0(a5)
    bge  a0, t2, else # if_else branch 2, not branch 4
    addi t0, t0, 1 # a = a+1
    jal  for_end
    
else:
    addi t0, t0, 2 # a = a+2

for_end:
	addi a5, a5, 4
	addi t1, t1, 1
    jal  loop_start
    
loop_end:

```

1. Alway-Taken
共 12 次分支跳转，判断错误 9 次，判断正确 12 次

2. Always-not-Taken
共 12 次分支跳转，判断错误 3 次，判断正确 9 次

### 3.2 B

 (b) The most classical implementation of the dynamic prediction is the Bimodal Predictor(see Note3 for more). It uses a branch history table to record previous branch taken states(counter) for different entries(usually mapped from lower n bit of the instruction’s address). So assume we have a branch history table with **8 entries** and the starting address of your code is **0x0**, **fill in the blank** of the history table(Table 3) initialized by 0. **Compare the performance with static branch prediction in (a)**. If better, explain it. If worse, suggest some method of improvement under the dynamic prediction. (10 points)
 
> [!Note] Iteration is indicated by variable i. In each iteration the counter may change for many times, just write it like 00→01→10.

定义 Strongly Taken as 00, Weakly Taken as 01, Weakly Not Taken as 10, Strongly Not Taken as 11。

entry 0: `beq  t1, t3, end # loop_end branch 1, not branch 5`

entry 1: `bge  a0, t2, else # if_else branch 2, not branch 4`

黑色表示预测正确，红色表示预测错误。

![[Pasted image 20231110061045.png]]

动态预测相对于静态预测有更好的性能，原因如下：

1. 动态预测可以根据先前的分支历史信息进行预测。它们保留了分支执行的历史记录，并根据历史数据来调整预测结果。而静态预测器仅基于固定的规则或模式进行预测，无法适应不同分支的变化。
2. 动态预测可以根据不同的程序和分支模式进行自适应调整。它们可以根据当前程序的运行时行为和分支指令的特性来调整预测策略。这种适应性使得动态预测器可以更准确地预测分支的方向，尤其是在存在复杂的分支模式和动态行为的情况下。

### 3.3 C

(c) In Figure 5, we move the branch test to ID stage with two main changes in the logic circuit: an adder in ID stage as one choice of PC, an equal test after the registers. However, if we move the equal test ahead in ID stage, it will raise extra data hazards. Assume we try to deal this by forwarding, please design the circuit again(add a forwarding unit to ID stage and its corresponding lines). (4 points) Note: 3 type of circumstances should be considered, please fill the Table 4. If the source operand is no need to be forwarded, leave the cell blank, otherwise, write the stage it is forwarded from. (6 points)

代码实现：

```verilog

    forwarding forwarding(
        .we_reg_wb(decode_wb[21]),
        .we_reg_mem(decode_mem[21]),
        .we_reg_exe(decode_exe[21]),
        .rd_wb(inst_wb[11:7]),
        .rd_mem(inst_mem[11:7]),
        .rd_exe(inst_exe[11:7]),
        .alu_out_exe(alu_out_exe),
        .alu_out_wb(alu_out_wb),
        .alu_out_mem(alu_out_mem),
        .rs1_id(inst_id[19:15]),
        .rs2_id(inst_id[24:20]),
        .immgen_op(decode_id[18:16]), // decode[18:16]

        .forwardA(forwardA),
        .forwardB(forwardB)
    );

    Mux4 forwardA_mux(
        .I0(read_data_1_id),
        .I1(decode_wb[4] ? trdata_wb : alu_out_wb), // decode[4] decide the reg read from memory or write back
        .I2(decode_mem[4] ? trdata_mem : alu_out_mem),
        .I3(decode_exe[4] ? trdata_exe : alu_out_exe),
        .s(forwardA),
        .o(real_data1_id)
    );

    Mux4 forwardB_mux(
        .I0(read_data_2_id),
        .I1(decode_wb[4] ? trdata_wb : alu_out_wb),
        .I2(decode_mem[4] ? trdata_mem : alu_out_mem),
        .I3(decode_exe[4] ? trdata_exe : alu_out_exe),
        .s(forwardB),
        .o(real_data2_id)
    );

```
